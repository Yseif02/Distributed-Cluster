# Distributed-Cluster
This project implements a scalable, fault-tolerant distributed master–worker cluster for serverless execution of Java programs. The system uses ZooKeeper-style leader election to dynamically select a leader, gossip-based heartbeats for decentralized failure detection, and automatic re-election and recovery on node failure. A gateway node provides a stable HTTP interface for clients while observing cluster state, routing requests to the current leader, and caching responses. The leader distributes work asynchronously to worker nodes using round-robin scheduling and request IDs to ensure correctness under failures. The system is built using multithreaded Java with UDP, TCP, and HTTP communication, and is designed to tolerate leader and worker crashes without losing client requests.
